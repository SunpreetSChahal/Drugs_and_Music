For this project I will need to find regarding:
1)Drug Usage/Popularity data - drug data/source providing information of the popular drugs per decade or year. If there is a lack of records but qualitative resources, 
I will have to reference the popular drug of each decade and contextualize a pattern. 
- https://www.caminorecovery.com/blog/7-drugs-for-7-decades/
- https://casapalmera.com/blog/the-history-of-illegal-drugs-in-america/
- https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/buyers/socialhistory.html

2) Music data - a record of the most popular songs per year. This data can be broken down into decades - 
splitting the most popular genres into decennial pies, and creating bar/line graphs to visualise the movement of each genre over time.
- https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=data.csv

Above are a few sources that I will be using during my analysis.

Plan:
1) Create a new Jupyter file - "History of Music and Drugs"
2) Load in all datasets that I will be using - primarily the spotify dataset
3)
