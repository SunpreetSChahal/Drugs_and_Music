The topic of the project is; The relation of the popular drugs every 5-10 years, and the most popular genre of music.
I aim to find out if the most listened to genres are correlated to the popular drugs that were used during that time, or if the shift in substance use birthed a new sub-genre. 

This project will differ from my previous work, interms of, the process. 
Within this project I will go through the 6 steps of completing a data project:
- 1) Project planning
- 2) Data collection
- 3) Data cleaning
- 4) Data exploration
- 5) Data visualisation 
- 7) Reporting or documenting the project
