# Music Evolution

## Introduction:
We have seen genres of music rise and fall. Once being the sound of the world, seemingly fade away. 
Every decade or generation seem give rise to a new sound or creats a whole new genre to fit the changing lives of people and atmosphere at the time.

I aim to visualise and analyse the development of music over the past 100 years. 

I will provide context behind the shifts of music, contextualizing the shifts though factors such as:

- Changing interests - A party fuelled generation or era that requires a new sound to fit the new hobbies.
  - The 1970s - The Disco Era; an era fuelled on partying, spawning world-renowned artists such as; The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and many more. The sound that these artists produced fit the era they were representing. 

- Use of drugs, for example;
  - Reggae music and marijuana, the typical sound of reggae is slow and relaxing, much like the effects of the substance associated with the genre. (https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/cannabis-the-facts/)
  - Metal music and cocaine/alcohol, the typical sound of metal is energetic and exhilarating, much like the effects of the substance(s) associated with the genre. (https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/cocaine/what-are-short-term-effects-cocaine-use)
