# Drugs & Music

Introduction:
We have seen genres of music rise and fall. Once being the sound of the world, seemingly fade away. 
Every decade or generation seem give rise to a new sound or creating a new genre.

Drugs come into the equation as it's known that different genres of music within various time periods had a spcific substance associated with it, for example;

- Reggae and marijuana, the typical sound of reggae is slow and relaxing, much like the effects of the substance associated with the genre. (https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/cannabis-the-facts/)
- Metal and cocaine/alcohol, the typical sound of metal is energetic and exhilarating, much like the effects of the substance(s) associated with the genre. (https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/cocaine/what-are-short-term-effects-cocaine-use)

The topic of the project is; The relation of the most-used drugs every 5-10 years, and the most popular genre of music.
I aim to find out if the most listened to genres are correlated to the popular drugs that were used during that time, or if the shift in substance use birthed a new sub-genre. 

This project will differ from my previous work, interms of, the process. 
Within this project I will go through the 6 steps of completing a data project:
1) Project planning
2) Data collection
3) Data cleaning
4) Data exploration
5) Data visualisation 
7) Reporting or documenting the project
